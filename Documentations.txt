Invenage Inventory Management System

- I build this while working for an import/export commercial company and hope someone will find
it useful

** Priority feature

- UI to access all database structure
- Functions to handle SQL connection

** Planned feature

- Moving to MySQL

 Both databases share these common tables:

- importLogBase: we normally will need to blank this at the beginning
- saleLogBase: will not be used in calculating the remaining, but useful for migrating from older system
- inventoryBase: store how much stock we have at system initialisation
- productInfo: all information regarding the product, more on this later
- Packaging: unit conversion table


Database usage:
- All codes will only append the database
