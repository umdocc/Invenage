Invenage Inventory Management System

- I build this while working for an import/export commercial company and hope someone will find
it useful

** The database

- importLogBase: we normally will need to blank this at the beginning
- saleLogBase: will not be used in calculating the remaining, but useful for migrating from older system
- inventoryBase: need to be updated at the beginning when migrating from old system
- productInfo: all information regarding the product

Database usage:
- All codes will only append the database
