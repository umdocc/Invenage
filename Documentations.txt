Invenage Inventory Management System

- I build this while working for an import/export commercial company and hope someone will find
it useful

** The database

 Invenage uses a master-slave database structure where the master data contains everything.
 The slave database contains information for the UI viewing and data entered using the UI.
 The master scripts will read these entered data, writing to master database, then rebuild the
 slave database when completed.
 
 Both databases share these common tables:

- importLogBase: we normally will need to blank this at the beginning
- saleLogBase: will not be used in calculating the remaining, but useful for migrating from older system
- inventoryBase: store how much stock we have at system initialisation
- productInfo: all information regarding the product, more on this later
- Packaging: unit conversion table


Database usage:
- All codes will only append the database
